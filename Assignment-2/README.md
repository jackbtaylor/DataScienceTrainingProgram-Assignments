# Intermediate Assignment 2: Cleaning Data

## Data: 
- USDA Food Sales Dataset (Edited)

## DataCamp: The following DataCamp courses correspond to this exercise:
- **Python**:
  - Data Manipulation with Pandas
  - Working with Dates and Times
  - Cleaning Data in Python

## Assignment:

1. Save the **USDA Food Sales Dataset** to your computer and import the data into a dataframe.
2. Look for extraneous rows at the start and end of the USDA Food Sales Dataset. Remove these rows from your dataframe.
3. Print the datatypes of your columns. Are there any numerical fields that may need to be converted to a more appropriate datatype?
4. A bug in the entry system was found that made it possible for duplicate entries to happen for a short time. Check the dataset for true duplicates and drop these.
5. Some variables were coded wrong due to entry error. Print the unique values of your categorical variables and their counts to find these errors. Remap them to the correct category.
6. Are there any missing values in the numeric fields? How would you handle these?
7. Convert the “Date” column to the datetime datatype. Are there any dates that may have been entered incorrectly? Drop these rows if found.
8. Using “Dollars,” Calculate the total dollars spent on alcohol in Alabama in year 2020.


## Deliverables:
- Your code (the .R, .Rmd, .py, or .ipynb file)
- These deliverables will be submitted through GitHub by the end of the program.
